# ðŸ§  Skin Disease Detection API (FastAPI + TensorFlow)

This is a FastAPI backend deployedd on google cloud for predicting skin diseases using a TensorFlow model with ResNet50 feature extraction. Users can upload an image, and the API will return the most likely skin condition from a predefined set of classes.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Accepts image uploads via `POST /`
- ðŸ§  Uses **ResNet50** for feature extraction
- ðŸ”¬ Pretrained TensorFlow model (`.h5`) for classification
- âš¡ Fast and lightweight API built with **FastAPI**
- ðŸ§ª Returns class label and prediction probability
